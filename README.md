# Docker-based Development Environment
This is my development environment. Feel free to adapt
and use as your own.

## Installation
1. install docker
2. set up your `~/.ssh` folder to use no password (optional)
3. clone the repo
4. customize the Dockerfile to suit your needs
5. run `./tag.sh`
6. make a shortcut to `run.sh` -- you can use this to enter the environment
