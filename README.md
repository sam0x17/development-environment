# Docker-based Development Environment
This is my development environment. Feel free to adapt
and use as your own.

## Installation
1. install docker
2. set up git and your `~/.ssh` folder to use no password
3. set up s3cmd locally
4. run `./generate.sh`
5. make a shortcut to `run.sh` -- you can use this to enter the environment
